      <h2>
         â€‹Hello, my name is Yuio Rivera. I'm graduating from California State University, Monterey Bay on June 2023. I also earned a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from University of California, Santa Cruz on June 2015.

         In the CS program, students learn fundamental computer science concepts while applying their knowledge to solve real-world problems. Collaboration, team work and communication skills are infused into the learning experiences with heavily project-based courses in a state-of-the-art technological environment.
         Students begin by taking a set of common core courses to establish a strong foundation in computer science, followed by taking courses in one of four concentration areas: software engineering, network and security, data science, or game development. The curriculum provides students the opportunity to learn concepts and develop skills in more than one concentration, helping them to become well rounded computer science professionals. <br>
         My career goal is to become a software engineer so I want to have a few projects worked out that I can use to demonstrate the skills that I have learned while going to school.
